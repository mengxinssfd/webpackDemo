Preact + Typesript + Webpack 4 + LESS / boilerplate
===

Things under the hood:
---
* [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)

Initial idea [Dominic St-Pierre](https://dominicstpierre.com/how-to-start-with-typescript-and-preact-a9ea3e0ba4dc)

I've tried to keep things as simple as possible.

Installation
---
1. Clone repository.
2. Run 'npm install' in the local copy (I hope you have NodeJS and NPM installed =)
3. Use one of:
    * `npm run build` for production build
    * `npm run dev` for development build (no minification)
    * `npm run start` for live server on `http://localhost:3030/`

Also, Windows shortcuts are here. See `*.bat` files.
